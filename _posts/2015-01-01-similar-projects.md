## Similar Projects

While working on SqlPad I ran across a few web-based projects that sort of overlap with what I was building. Some have a focus on visualization, some just writing SQL and other adminstrative tasks.

I haven't tried most of these out personally, but the look like they are worth checking out if you are looking for a web-app to execute SQL in. 

Have a project or product I can add to this list? Let me know via pull request, GitHub issue, or email to rick.bergfalk@gmail.com.



**[pgcharts](https://github.com/dimitri/pgcharts)**

Web app with a focus on charting query results. Simple interface, Postgres only.


**[FnordMetric](http://fnordmetric.io/chartsql/)**

Create charts using SQL with this web-based tool. Unsure of the databases supported, but it sounds like MySQL and CSV files


**[re:dash](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash)**

Web application that allows you to query a variety of databases and share the dataset and visualize it in different ways, including dashboards.


**[pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb)**

A Postgres only web app with a focus on writing SQL and exploring the structure of a database. Query results can be exported to CSV. Nice clean design. Likely target is database administration.
