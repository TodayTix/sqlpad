# SqlPad

A web app for writing and running SQL queries and visualizing the results. Supports Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server and Vertica.

SqlPad is meant to be run on an internal network for a single team. All connections added to the app can be used by all individuals with access to the SqlPad server. All queries written can be run and edited by everyone on the server. 

If you want to be bold and daring, you can expose your SqlPad instance to the outside world. Please make sure you fully understand the risks associated with doing this and use SSL.
