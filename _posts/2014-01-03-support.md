## Support & Future of this Project

### ~~not much now, but that could change~~ it changed

I started this project as a personal side-project so I could run queries from a chromebook and visualize the results with some simple visualizations. 

I no longer use my chromebook much, but I have ideas I want to explore in regards to querying and reporting off data in a relational database.
