<p>Be sure to not forget your password to your user account. As of now there&#39;s no way to reset it.</p>
<p>Even though username is based on an email address, in no way does SqlPad have the capability to email that address.</p>
<p>Be sure not to query with 2 columns returned of the same name. Some SQL reporting systems can handle this. SqlPad can&#39;t.</p>
<p>Every query run is done with a new session/connection, so keep that in mind if you use variables and temp tables and split up your SQL executions. If this doesn&#39;t make any sense to you just forget you read this you probably won&#39;t be impacted by it.</p>
<p>Have you hit a weird limitation you&#39;d like us to know about? Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad/issues">add a GitHub issue about it</a>. </p>

				Hello! I'm a Business Intelligence developer/SQL Server DBA that dabbles with web development on the side via Node.js.
				Yes, it's an odd combination. You can find most of my web-related code on <a href="http://github.com/rickbergfalk">GitHub</a>. 
				I'm also on <a href="http://twitter.com/rickbergfalk">Twitter</a>, although I don't tweet much.
